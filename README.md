Rich Summative Task 3

Chess is believed to have originated in India, some time before the 7th century. The pieces took on their current powers in Spain in the late 15th century; the rules were finally standardized in the 19th century. 

Chess is a two-player board game played on a chessboard, a checkered game board with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid.

Each player begins the game with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. Each of the six piece types moves differently. The most powerful piece is the queen and the least powerful piece is the pawn. The objective is to 'checkmate' the opponent's king by placing it under an inescapable threat of capture. To this end, a player's pieces are used to attack and capture the opponent's pieces, while supporting their own. In addition to checkmate, the game can be won by voluntary resignation by the opponent, which typically occurs when too much material is lost, or if checkmate appears unavoidable.

Using the Case Study format and Object-Oriented Development, in groups of two or three students, create a game of chess. Ensure that you have a game board of 64 squares, two players- one Black and one White. Both sides have 8 Pawns, two Rooks, two Knights, two Bishops, a Queen and a King. 

Queens always start on their own colour and White always moves first. 

Ensure that you have classes and objects and methods that define their behavior. 

Ensure that your assignment contains all of the steps used in a Case Study including: 

Specification

Algorithm

Flowchart 

Code Design 

Implementation

Testing and Debugging.
